function varargout = Trabalho_Angelo(varargin)
% TRABALHO_ANGELO MATLAB code for Trabalho_Angelo.fig
%      TRABALHO_ANGELO, by itself, creates a new TRABALHO_ANGELO or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = TRABALHO_ANGELO returns the handle to a new TRABALHO_ANGELO or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      TRABALHO_ANGELO('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in TRABALHO_ANGELO.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      TRABALHO_ANGELO('Property','Value',...) creates a new TRABALHO_ANGELO or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Trabalho_Angelo_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Trabalho_Angelo_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
